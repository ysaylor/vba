'The objective is to categorize, summarize and display stock ticket symbols for all worksheets in the workbook titled, "Multi_Year_Stock_Data.xlsx" with the following information:

    • Yearly change from the first of the year’s stock opened price to the end of the year’s closing price
    • The percentage change from the first of the year’s stock opened price to the end of the year’s closing price. The           positive change would be highlighted in green and negative change would be highlighted in red.
    • The total stock volume amount

'The data sets are located in all active worksheets on the workbook titled, "Multi_Year_Stock_data.xlsx". The date sets within each worksheet that will be used are the infinite number of rows until the end of the data table as well as the specified columns named <ticker>, <open>, <close>, and <vol>.
